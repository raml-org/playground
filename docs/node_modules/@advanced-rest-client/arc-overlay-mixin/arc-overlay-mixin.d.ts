/**
 * This mixin is a port of [IronOverlayBehavior](https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-overlay-behavior)
 * that works with LitElement.
 *
 * Use `ArcOverlayMixin` to implement an element that can be hidden
 * or shown, and displays on top of other content. It includes an optional
 * backdrop, and can be used to implement a variety of UI controls including
 * dialogs and drop downs. Multiple overlays may be displayed at once.
 * See the [demo source
 * code](https://github.com/advanced-rest-client/arc-overlay-mixin/blob/master/demo/simple-overlay.html)
 * for an example.
 *
 * ### Closing and canceling
 *
 * An overlay may be hidden by closing or canceling. The difference between close
 * and cancel is user intent. Closing generally implies that the user
 * acknowledged the content on the overlay. By default, it will cancel whenever
 * the user taps outside it or presses the escape key. This behavior is
 * configurable with the `no-cancel-on-esc-key` and the
 * `no-cancel-on-outside-click` properties. `close()` should be called explicitly
 * by the implementer when the user interacts with a control in the overlay
 * element. When the dialog is canceled, the overlay fires an
 * 'iron-overlay-canceled' event. Call `preventDefault` on this event to prevent
 * the overlay from closing.
 *
 * ### Positioning
 *
 * By default the element is sized and positioned to fit and centered inside the
 * window. You can position and size it manually using CSS. See `ArcFitMixin`.
 *
 * ### Backdrop
 *
 * Set the `with-backdrop` attribute to display a backdrop behind the overlay.
 * The backdrop is appended to `<body>` and is of type `<iron-overlay-backdrop>`.
 * See its doc page for styling options.
 * In addition, `with-backdrop` will wrap the focus within the content in the
 * light DOM. Override the [`_focusableNodes`
 * getter](#ArcOverlayMixin:property-_focusableNodes) to achieve a
 * different behavior.
 *
 * ### Limitations
 *
 * The element is styled to appear on top of other content by setting its
 * `z-index` property. You must ensure no element has a stacking context with a
 * higher `z-index` than its parent stacking context. You should place this
 * element as a child of `<body>` whenever possible.
 *
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * ```javascript
 * import { LitElement } from 'lit-element';
 * import { ArcOverlayMixin } from '@advanced-rest-client/arc-overlay-mixin/arc-overlay-mixin.js';
 *
 * class ArcOverlayImpl extends ArcOverlayMixin(LitElement) {
 *  ...
 * }
 * ```
