      # This is an example API spec
      The API doesn't exists in the real world therefore calls made to any endpoint will always fail.
      If you'd like to perform actual request and see the response try GitHub API (which doesn't require user authentication in some endpoints) or other APIs.
      Note that you may need a Client ID or valid authorization token to perform a call to some APIs that are secured by the OAuth 2 protocol.
      Thank you for testing the API console. Your feedback is welcome. Email us: arc@mulesoft.com
